# Description:
This project is a set of text mathematical games.

This project contains:
1. *brain-even* - Determine if a number is even
2. *brain-calc* - Calculate the proposed expression
3. *brain-gcd* - Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
4. *brain-progression* - Determine the missing element of an arithmetic progression
5. *brain-prime* - Determine if a number is prime
